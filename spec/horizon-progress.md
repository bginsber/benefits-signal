# Horizon-scanning loop ledger

Companion to `spec/horizon-scanning-goal.md`. The loop appends one entry per iteration. Nothing above the first iteration entry is edited by the loop except the milestone table.

## Milestone status

| Milestone | Status | Last verified |
|---|---|---|
| M1 · Scans and sources become data | not started | |
| M2 · Close the source gaps | not started | |
| M3 · Normalize and scan-match | not started | |
| M4 · Cluster, verify, assess | not started | |
| M5 · Weekly candidate digest | not started | |
| M6 · Front end reads data | not started | |
| M7 · Obligations and trustee agenda | not started | |

## Baseline · 2026-09-01 · before iteration 1

Recorded by hand before the loop starts, so iteration 1 has a known starting point.

- **Repo state.** Three commits on `main`, working tree clean. `scripts/collect.mjs` (233 lines, zero dependencies) collects four RSS sources (Groom, Trucker Huss, Wagner, Word on Benefits) and the Federal Register API for six agency slugs, stores one JSON per document under `data/collected/` keyed by URL hash, and writes `data/run-log.json` and a collated RSS feed. Source lists are hard-coded arrays in the script; `spec/sources.yaml` is documentation only.
- **Last local run.** `data/run-log.json` from 2026-09-02T04:59Z: 285 items in a 30-day window, 287 documents stored; Wagner returned HTTP 403 (Cloudflare challenge, intermittent); the other four sources were ok.
- **Front end.** `src/App.jsx` (273 lines) renders three hard-coded developments and a ten-row hard-coded source log. `spec/issue-schema.json` defines the JSON contract the front end would consume; nothing produces it yet.
- **Tests.** `tests/sites-worker.test.mjs` only. `npm run build` and `npm run test:sites` are the existing checks.
- **Deploy.** `.github/workflows/collate.yml` runs the collector daily at 12:17 UTC and on any push to `main` touching the collector, and deploys `_site/` to GitHub Pages at `https://bginsber.github.io/benefits-signal/collated.xml`. Pushing deploys; Ben authorized the loop to push after each green iteration.
- **Model calls.** None exist in the repo. No `@anthropic-ai/sdk` dependency yet.
- **Known non-collectable sources.** EBIA Weekly (email only), dol.gov and hhs.gov newsrooms (403 from datacenter IPs). Segal's listing is JavaScript-rendered; the underlying JSON endpoint has not been located.
- **Decisions already taken by default** (spec § 14): none applied yet. The loop applies the recommended defaults as each milestone reaches them and records them here.
